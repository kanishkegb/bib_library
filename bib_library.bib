  abstract  = {Image registration finds a variety of applications in computer vision. Unfortunately, traditional image registration techniques tend to be costly. We present a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is faster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques. Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show show our technique can be adapted for use in a stereo vision system.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a review of the state of the art and a novel classification of current vision-based localization techniques in unknown environments. Indeed, due to progresses made in computer vision, it is now possible to consider vision-based systems as promising navigation means that can complement traditional navigation sensors like Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). This paper aims to review techniques employing a camera as a localization sensor, provide a classification of techniques and introduce schemes that exploit the use of video information within a multi-sensor system. In fact, a general model is needed to better compare existing techniques in order to decide which approach is appropriate and which are the innovation axes. In addition, existing classifications only consider techniques based on vision as a standalone tool and do not consider video as a sensor among others. The focus is addressed to scenarios where no a priori knowledge of the environment is provided. In fact, these scenarios are the most challenging since the system has to cope with objects as they appear in the scene without any prior information about their expected position.},

Our system relies on stereo vision to robustly estimate frame-to-frame motion in real time (also known as visual odometry). The motion estimation problem is formulated efficiently in the disparity space and results in accurate and robust estimates of the motion even for a small-baseline configuration. Our system uses inertial measurements to fill in motion estimates when visual odometry fails. This incremental motion is then fused with a low-cost GPS sensor using a Kalman Filter to prevent long-term drifts. Experimental results are presented for outdoor localization in moderately sized environments (â‰¥100 meters)},

  abstract    = {This paper provides new results for control of complex flight maneuvers for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The flight maneuvers are defined by a concatenation of flight modes or primitives, each of which is achieved by a nonlinear controller that solves an output tracking problem. A mathematical model of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics, defined on the configuration space $\SE$, is introduced as a basis for the analysis. The quadrotor UAV has four input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four rotor thrusts; each flight mode is defined by solving an asymptotic optimal tracking problem. Although many flight modes can be studied, we focus on three output tracking problems, namely (1) outputs given by the vehicle attitude, (2) outputs given by the three position variables for the vehicle center of mass, and (3) output given by the three velocity variables for the vehicle center of mass. A nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group $\SE$ for each flight mode, and the closed loop is shown to have desirable closed loop properties that are almost global in each case. Several numerical examples, including one example in which the quadrotor recovers from being initially upside down and another example that includes switching and transitions between different flight modes, illustrate the versatility and generality of the proposed approach.},

  title       = {Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization},
  abstract    = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  title       = {Toward Low-Flying Autonomous MAV Trail Navigation using Deep Neural Networks for Environmental Awareness},
  abstract    = {We present a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) system, built with inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware, for autonomously following trails in unstructured, outdoor environments such as forests. The system introduces a deep neural network (DNN) called TrailNet for estimating the view orientation and lateral offset of the MAV with respect to the trail center. The DNN-based controller achieves stable flight without oscillations by avoiding overconfident behavior through a loss function that includes both label smoothing and entropy reward. In addition to the TrailNet DNN, the system also utilizes vision modules for environmental awareness, including another DNN for object detection and a visual odometry component for estimating depth for the purpose of low-level obstacle detection. All vision systems run in real time on board the MAV via a Jetson TX1. We provide details on the hardware and software used, as well as implementation details. We present experiments showing the ability of our system to navigate forest trails more robustly than previous techniques, including autonomous flights of 1 km.},

  title       = {Estimation and Tracking of a Moving Target by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles},
  abstract    = {An image-based control strategy along with estimation of target motion is developed to track dynamic targets without motion constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes a bounding box as image features for tracking control and estimation of dynamic target without motion constraint. The features generated from a You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) deep neural network can relax the assumption of continuous availability of the feature points in most literature and minimize the gap for applications. The challenges are that the motion pattern of the target is unknown and modeling its dynamics is infeasible. To resolve these issues, the dynamics of the target is modeled by a constant-velocity model and is employed as a process model in the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), but process noise is uncertain and sensitive to system instability. To ensure convergence of the estimate error, the noise covariance matrix is estimated according to history data within a moving window. The estimated motion from the UKF is implemented as a feedforward term in the developed controller, so that tracking performance is enhanced. Simulations are demonstrated to verify the efficacy of the developed estimator and controller.},

  abstract    = {This paper proposes a solution to the attitude tracking problem for a novel quadrotor tailsitter unmanned aerial vehicle called swiveling biplane quadrotor. The proposed vehicle design addresses the lack of yaw control authority in conventional biplane quadrotor tailsitters by proposing a new design wherein two wings with two attached propellers are joined together with a rod through a swivel mechanism. The yaw torque is generated by relative rotation of the thrust vector of each wing. The unique design of this configuration having two rigid bodies interconnected through a rod with zero torsional rigidity makes the vehicle underactuated in the attitude configuration manifold. An output tracking problem is posed which results in a single equivalent rigid body attitude tracking problem with second-order moment dynamics. The proposed controller is uniformly valid for all attitudes and is based on dynamic feedback linearization in a geometric control framework. Almost-global asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium of the tracking error dynamics is shown. The efficacy of the controller is shown with numerical simulation and flight tests.},

  title       = {Design, Modeling, and Control of Norma: a Slider and Pendulum-Driven Spherical Robot},
  abstract    = {This paper discusses the design, modeling, and control of Norma, a novel 2 DOF mobile spherical robot (SR). The propelling mechanism of this robot consists of two actuators: a slider, and a rotational pendulum located on the SR's diagonal shaft. The slider can translate along the shaft and shift the robot's center of gravity towards the robot's sides. The pendulum rotates around the shaft to propel the SR to roll forward and backward. These two actuators enable the SR to perform both rolling and turning maneuvers as a nonholonomic robot. The advantage of the proposed mechanical design lies in its convenience of physical implementation, agility, and accurate mathematical model. The Euler Lagrange approach is utilized to derive the dynamics of the proposed mechanical structure using minimum simplifications possible. Further, a path tracking control scheme is introduced for a smooth trajectory. Finally, simulations are carried out in MATLAB to verify the accuracy of the mathematical model and the effectiveness of the controller against experimental results.},

  abstract    = {This paper introduces an advanced Lyapunov stability analysis for an attitude observer that has been developed on the special orthogonal group. In particular, when the attitude observer is constructed based on multiple direction measurements toward known reference points, a local exponential stability has been established by linearization, under the assumption that those reference points are fixed in the inertial frame. Several modifications have been proposed to deal with reference directions changing over time. Here, we present an alternative Lyapunov analysis to show that the attitude observer still exhibits exponential stability for time-varying reference directions, under the assumption that the observer gain is sufficiently large relative to the rate of change of the reference directions. These are illustrated by a numerical example, followed by experimental results with visual marker detection in an indoor space.},
