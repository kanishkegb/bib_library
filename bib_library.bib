  abstract  = {Image registration finds a variety of applications in computer vision. Unfortunately, traditional image registration techniques tend to be costly. We present a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is faster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques. Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show show our technique can be adapted for use in a stereo vision system.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a review of the state of the art and a novel classification of current vision-based localization techniques in unknown environments. Indeed, due to progresses made in computer vision, it is now possible to consider vision-based systems as promising navigation means that can complement traditional navigation sensors like Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). This paper aims to review techniques employing a camera as a localization sensor, provide a classification of techniques and introduce schemes that exploit the use of video information within a multi-sensor system. In fact, a general model is needed to better compare existing techniques in order to decide which approach is appropriate and which are the innovation axes. In addition, existing classifications only consider techniques based on vision as a standalone tool and do not consider video as a sensor among others. The focus is addressed to scenarios where no a priori knowledge of the environment is provided. In fact, these scenarios are the most challenging since the system has to cope with objects as they appear in the scene without any prior information about their expected position.},

Our system relies on stereo vision to robustly estimate frame-to-frame motion in real time (also known as visual odometry). The motion estimation problem is formulated efficiently in the disparity space and results in accurate and robust estimates of the motion even for a small-baseline configuration. Our system uses inertial measurements to fill in motion estimates when visual odometry fails. This incremental motion is then fused with a low-cost GPS sensor using a Kalman Filter to prevent long-term drifts. Experimental results are presented for outdoor localization in moderately sized environments (â‰¥100 meters)},

  abstract    = {This paper provides new results for control of complex flight maneuvers for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The flight maneuvers are defined by a concatenation of flight modes or primitives, each of which is achieved by a nonlinear controller that solves an output tracking problem. A mathematical model of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics, defined on the configuration space $\SE$, is introduced as a basis for the analysis. The quadrotor UAV has four input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four rotor thrusts; each flight mode is defined by solving an asymptotic optimal tracking problem. Although many flight modes can be studied, we focus on three output tracking problems, namely (1) outputs given by the vehicle attitude, (2) outputs given by the three position variables for the vehicle center of mass, and (3) output given by the three velocity variables for the vehicle center of mass. A nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group $\SE$ for each flight mode, and the closed loop is shown to have desirable closed loop properties that are almost global in each case. Several numerical examples, including one example in which the quadrotor recovers from being initially upside down and another example that includes switching and transitions between different flight modes, illustrate the versatility and generality of the proposed approach.},

  abstract    = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract    = {We present a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) system, built with inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware, for autonomously following trails in unstructured, outdoor environments such as forests. The system introduces a deep neural network (DNN) called TrailNet for estimating the view orientation and lateral offset of the MAV with respect to the trail center. The DNN-based controller achieves stable flight without oscillations by avoiding overconfident behavior through a loss function that includes both label smoothing and entropy reward. In addition to the TrailNet DNN, the system also utilizes vision modules for environmental awareness, including another DNN for object detection and a visual odometry component for estimating depth for the purpose of low-level obstacle detection. All vision systems run in real time on board the MAV via a Jetson TX1. We provide details on the hardware and software used, as well as implementation details. We present experiments showing the ability of our system to navigate forest trails more robustly than previous techniques, including autonomous flights of 1 km.},

  abstract    = {An image-based control strategy along with estimation of target motion is developed to track dynamic targets without motion constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes a bounding box as image features for tracking control and estimation of dynamic target without motion constraint. The features generated from a You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) deep neural network can relax the assumption of continuous availability of the feature points in most literature and minimize the gap for applications. The challenges are that the motion pattern of the target is unknown and modeling its dynamics is infeasible. To resolve these issues, the dynamics of the target is modeled by a constant-velocity model and is employed as a process model in the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), but process noise is uncertain and sensitive to system instability. To ensure convergence of the estimate error, the noise covariance matrix is estimated according to history data within a moving window. The estimated motion from the UKF is implemented as a feedforward term in the developed controller, so that tracking performance is enhanced. Simulations are demonstrated to verify the efficacy of the developed estimator and controller.},

  abstract    = {This paper proposes a solution to the attitude tracking problem for a novel quadrotor tailsitter unmanned aerial vehicle called swiveling biplane quadrotor. The proposed vehicle design addresses the lack of yaw control authority in conventional biplane quadrotor tailsitters by proposing a new design wherein two wings with two attached propellers are joined together with a rod through a swivel mechanism. The yaw torque is generated by relative rotation of the thrust vector of each wing. The unique design of this configuration having two rigid bodies interconnected through a rod with zero torsional rigidity makes the vehicle underactuated in the attitude configuration manifold. An output tracking problem is posed which results in a single equivalent rigid body attitude tracking problem with second-order moment dynamics. The proposed controller is uniformly valid for all attitudes and is based on dynamic feedback linearization in a geometric control framework. Almost-global asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium of the tracking error dynamics is shown. The efficacy of the controller is shown with numerical simulation and flight tests.},

  abstract    = {This paper discusses the design, modeling, and control of Norma, a novel 2 DOF mobile spherical robot (SR). The propelling mechanism of this robot consists of two actuators: a slider, and a rotational pendulum located on the SR's diagonal shaft. The slider can translate along the shaft and shift the robot's center of gravity towards the robot's sides. The pendulum rotates around the shaft to propel the SR to roll forward and backward. These two actuators enable the SR to perform both rolling and turning maneuvers as a nonholonomic robot. The advantage of the proposed mechanical design lies in its convenience of physical implementation, agility, and accurate mathematical model. The Euler Lagrange approach is utilized to derive the dynamics of the proposed mechanical structure using minimum simplifications possible. Further, a path tracking control scheme is introduced for a smooth trajectory. Finally, simulations are carried out in MATLAB to verify the accuracy of the mathematical model and the effectiveness of the controller against experimental results.},

  year        = {2019},
  abstract    = {The control of a quadrotor is typically split into two subsequent problems: finding desired accelerations to control its position, and controlling its attitude and the total thrust to track these accelerations and to track a yaw angle reference. While the thrust vector, generating accelerations, and the angle of rotation about the thrust vector, determining the yaw angle, can be controlled independently, most attitude control strategies in the literature, relying on representations in terms of quaternions, rotation matrices or Euler angles, result in an unnecessary coupling between the control of the thrust vector and of the angle about this vector. This leads, for instance, to undesired position tracking errors due to yaw tracking errors. In this paper we propose to tackle the attitude control problem using an attitude representation in the Cartesian product of the 2-sphere and the 1-sphere, denoted by $\mathcal{S}^2\times \mathcal{S}^1$. We propose a non-linear tracking control law on $\mathcal{S}^2\times \mathcal{S}^1$ that decouples the control of the thrust vector and of the angle of rotation about the thrust vector, and guarantees almost global asymptotic stability. Simulation results highlight the advantages of the proposed approach over previous approaches.},

  year        = {2020},
  abstract    = {With much research has been conducted into trajectory planning for quadrotors, planning with spatial and temporal optimal trajectories in real-time is still challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework for generating large-scale piecewise polynomial trajectories for aggressive autonomous flights, with highlights on its superior computational efficiency and simultaneous spatial-temporal optimality. Exploiting the implicitly decoupled structure of the planning problem, we conduct alternating minimization between boundary conditions and time durations of trajectory pieces. In each minimization phase, we leverage the algebraic convenience of the sub-problem to escape poor local minima and achieve the lowest time consumption. Theoretical analysis for the global/local convergence rate of our proposed method is provided. Moreover, based on polynomial theory, an extremely fast feasibility check method is designed for various kinds of constraints. By incorporating the method into our alternating structure, a constrained minimization algorithm is constructed to optimize trajectories on the premise of feasibility. Benchmark evaluation shows that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding efficiency, optimality, and scalability. Aggressive flight experiments in a limited space with dense obstacles are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. We release our implementation as an open-source ros-package.},

  abstract      = {The attitude of a rigid body evolves on the three-dimensional special orthogonal group, and it is often estimated by measuring reference directions, such as gravity or magnetic field, using an onboard sensor. As a single direction measurement provides a two-dimensional constraint, it has been widely accepted that at least two non-parallel reference directions should be measured, or the reference direction should change over time, to determine the attitude completely. This paper uncovers an intriguing fact that the attitude can actually be estimated by using multiple measurements of a single, fixed reference direction, provided that the angular velocity and the direction measurements are resolved in appropriate frames, respectively. More specifically, after recognizing that the attitude uncertainties propagated over the left-trivialized stochastic kinematics are distinct from those over the right-trivialized one, stochastic attitude observability with single direction measurements is formulated by an information theoretic analysis. These are further illustrated by numerical simulations and experiments.},

  abstract      = {We present a novel, high-performance attitude control law for multicopters, with a view to recovery from large disturbances. The controller is compared to three well-established alternatives from the literature. All controllers considered are identical to first order, but differ in their computation of the attitude error. We show that the popular use of the skew-symmetric part of the rotation matrix is problematic from a safety perspective, and specifically that the closed loop system may linger at large attitude errors for an arbitrary duration (leading to potential failures of practical systems). The novel proposed controller prioritizes the error in the vehicle thrust direction, and is shown to outperform a similar, existing controller from the literature. Stability follows via a Lyapunov function, and the controller is validated in experiments. This novel controller is especially attractive in safety-critical situations, where a multicopter may be required to recover from large initial disturbances.},

  abstract      = {The attitude of a rigid-body in the three dimensional space has a unique and global definition on the Special Orthogonal Group SO (3). This paper gives an overview of the rotation matrix, attitude kinematics and parameterization. The four most frequently used methods of attitude representations are discussed with detailed derivations, namely Euler angles, angle-axis parameterization, Rodriguez vector, and unit-quaternion. The mapping from one representation to others including SO (3) is given. Also, important results which could be useful for the process of filter and/or control design are given. The main weaknesses of attitude parameterization using Euler angles, angle-axis parameterization, Rodriguez vector, and unit-quaternion are illustrated.
